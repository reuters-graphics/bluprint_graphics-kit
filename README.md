## Quickstart

This rig is best used with [bluprint](https://github.com/reuters-graphics/bluprint), our in-house templating tool.

If you haven't already, add this bluprint to your CLI.

```
bluprint add reuters-graphics/bluprint_graphics-kit
```

Make a new directory and use the bluprint.

```
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
bluprint start
```

## 📚 Developer Docs

Read more in the **[developer docs](docs/developers/README.md)** about how to use this rig to create graphics pages.

## 🚀 Status

This kit is **now ready for active use**, and we are starting the process of sunsetting the [current, Webpack-based rig](https://github.com/reuters-graphics/bluprint_graphics-rig).

That said, there may still be issues as [SvelteKit continues to work towards a 1.0 release](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/master/packages/kit/CHANGELOG.md) and as we continue to develop the boilerplate projects start from.

**If this is your first time using this kit**, please build in a little extra time around your deadline in case you need any help when building, uploading and publishing your project.

☎️ If you do need help, reach out to one of our developers:
