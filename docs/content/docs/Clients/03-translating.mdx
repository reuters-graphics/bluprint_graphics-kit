You can translate Reuters graphics into whatever language you prefer directly in the project's source files.

## Translating content files

Most text content for graphics pages is located in JSON files in the `locales/` directory of the project. Translating the text in `locales/en/content.json`, for example, and then rebuilding the project (see [Self-hosting graphics](/bluprint_graphics-kit/clients/self-hosting/)) will replace the text on the page with whatever language you choose.

For example, you could translate the below text in English...

```json
// locales/en/content.json
{
  "greeting": "Hello!"
}
```

... into German, being sure **not** to translate the _keys_ in the JSON, just the values.

```json
// locales/en/content.json
{
  "greeting": "Servus!"
}
```

Some values may contain one or more `\n` or `\r\n` characters, which represent line breaks separating paragraphs. You should not remove those characters unless there is no longer text following them.

```json "\n\n"
// locales/en/content.json
{
  "someText": "Disney’s “Snow White” reaches theaters on Friday.\n\nThe big-budget adaptation of Walt Disney’s original princess story has been in the works since 2016."
}
```

## Other text content

Some text content for things like annotations on individual charts may be located in components that live in the `src/lib/` directory. You can also edit this text within the code and rebuild the project to replace the text with your translation.

You can also translate text on graphics created with Adobe Illustrator and re-export them using [ai2svelte](/bluprint_graphics-kit/developers/adobe-illustrator-graphics/#ai2svelte).

## RTL languages

If you're translating into a right-to-left language like Arabic or Hebrew, you'll likely want to set the [text direction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/dir) and [language](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang) properties in the HTML template shell in the `src/template.html` file.

```html ins={4} del={3}
<!-- src/template.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="%lang%">
<html lang="ar" dir="rtl">
  <!-- ... -->
</html>
```

You _may_ also need to override right or left-oriented style rules within the project. In most cases, you should be able to do this by (carefully) adding important rules in the `global.scss` file.

```scss ins={2-5}
// src/lib/styles/global.scss
.a-left-padded-element {
  padding-left: 0;
  padding-inline-start: 10px !important;
}
```
