Publishing a preview of your project and uploading and publishing through the Sphinx graphics server is handled by the graphics kit publisher.

<LinkCard

  color="var(--sl-color-green)"
  icon="open-book"
  href="https://reuters-graphics.github.io/graphics-kit-publisher/"
  target="_blank"
/>

## Commands

### Preview

Create a shareable preview of your project.

```console
pnpm preview
```

### Upload

Upload your project to the Sphinx graphics server.

```console
pnpm upload
```

<Aside type="tip">
Some code errors are only discovered when building your project for preview or during upload to the Sphinx graphics server.

It's always a good idea to **upload your project well ahead of when you intend to publish it** so you have time to solve any potential issues with your code well ahead of your deadline.
</Aside>

### Publish

Publish your previously uploaded project in the Sphinx graphics server.

```console
pnpm pub
```
