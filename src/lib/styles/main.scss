/**
This is a global SCSS stylesheet. 

✋ BEFORE YOU USE THIS...
Remember, it's better to write styles in your components so they'll be safely scoped to
just the elements you mean to style.

This stylesheet *is* a good place *if* you're writing styles that will be shared across several components.

You can import and use this partial in your Svelte components like this:

<style lang="scss">
  :global{
    @import './styles/main';
  }
</style>
**/
